# Sound Files

Drop your custom WAV file here as **`undo.wav`** and the extension will automatically use it.

### Requirements
- Format: **WAV** (`.wav`)
- Short clips work best (under 1 second)

### Custom path
If you want to use a WAV file stored somewhere else on your system,
go to **Settings → Extensions → Undo Sound** and set the
`undo-sound.soundFilePath` to the full absolute path of your file.

Example (Windows):
```
C:\Users\YourName\sounds\my-undo-sound.wav
```
